Previous changelog from WP Business Directory Manager

Version 1.9.3 - Sticky listings fix for error where upgraded listings were not being listed under "Manage Featured". 
		
		Paid listings fix for error where paid listings were not being listed under "Manage Payments"
		
		Applied fix for payment calculation and handling where users are allowed to submit listing to multiple categories
		
		Fixed bug with images where number of images left wass sometimes greater than the total number of images allowed
		
		[ Thanks to Mike Bronner for his help with the below list of improvements and fixes to the plugin]

		- Fixed issue where shortcodes would always cause the Add Listing Form to display prior to content.

		- XHTML compliant.

		- More versatile arrangement of form elements.

		- Improved label handling (added proper IDs and FOR attributes).

		- Changed 'wp_dropdown_categories' function call to pass in an array of arguments, and adding arguments "echo" and "class".

		- Added functionality so that required fields receive a class name 'required'. This will allow for highlighting of required fields, etc.

		- Added "required" class to input fields in AddListing form, allowing them to be stylized.

		- Internal code optimization and cleanup.

		- Added hooks (filters) on functions that display HTML to allow user overrides of those functions in functions.php in their template. This is possible by removing the filters, then re-adding them and pointing to their own functions using the functions.php file in their theme.

		- "Add Listing" form will now submit back to itself. This will allow you to retain styling of the form separate from the directory. It is also no longer necessary for the Add Listing page to be a child of the Directory page.

		- Expanded slightly on the hookability of the add listing functionality, further allowing other developers to extend the plugin.

		- Updated text to be displayed on add listing form is user wasn't logged in.

		- Wrapped free-standing text in token function, where not already done so (__("text", "WPBDM")).

		- Fixed heading "Step 2" on image upload form to be H2 tag instead of H3 tag (syntactically correct, as there is otherwise no H2 tag).



Version 1.9.2 - Attempts to fix "undefined function flush_rewrite_rules" issue
		Fixes "Wrong datatype for second argument" error when using checkbox field type for category field
		Fixes default picture bug ( default picture not displaying )


Version 1.9.1 - Fixes a bug that defaults all extra fields to a type of text box regardless what the administrator selects. This bug was only present in version 1.9.0.

Regarding the google checkout it seems some previous versions were displaying the shortcode at all times and not showing the actual page content. Change made: The line 
		
		add_shortcode('WPBUSDIRMANGOOGLECHECKOUT', 'wpbusdirman_do_googlecheckout'); 
		
		was changed to 
		
		if($wpbusdirman_hasgooglecheckoutmodule == 1)
		{
			add_shortcode('WPBUSDIRMANGOOGLECHECKOUT', 'wpbusdirman_do_googlecheckout');
		}
		
		and moved to below
		
		if($wpbusdirman_hastwocheckoutmodule == 1)
		{
			add_shortcode('WPBUSDIRMANTWOCHECKOUT', 'wpbusdirman_do_twocheckout');
		}
		
		The update also adds 3 new options under a new setting "Permalink Options" that allows you to change the wpbdm-directory slug, the wpbdm-category slug and the wpbdm-tags slug. Please take note of the fact that you cannot use "category" or "tags" or any already reserved WordPress taxonomy names for your slugs as it will make your pages fail to load.


Version 1.8.8 - This version has a small fix in a function related to the payment process on sites that have only one fee setting applied to all categories.

		Fixes missing quote bug near img alt on a couple of lines 



Version 1.8 of Business Directory Plugin makes use of WordPress 3.0+ custom post types. The way the plugin works has been completely changed to use custom post types. When you upgrade to version 1.8 it will convert your previous installation to the new format. The new format conversion is not guaranteed to work 100% so you are very strongly advised if you have listings in your directory presently to export those listings in case you might need to re-add them manually. 

Plugin now uses a custom post type for posts related to the directory

Plugin now uses a custom category taxonomy for categories related to the directory

Plugin now uses a custom tags taxonomy for tags related to the directory listings

Plugin now allows for better integration with your theme. See the "Usage Doc" section for information on how to customize your theme to use the plugin functions.

Bug related to "Manage Fees" has been fixed. This bug resulted in admin being told payments were not turned on even though payments were in fact turned on.



== Upgrade Notice ==

1. If you are upgrading please export your current data first. There is always the possibility of something going wrong during the upgrading process. Failing to save your data before you upgrade can prove costly if something goes wrong and your data gets lost. Backup your database. Backup your files. 

2. If you are not using WP 3.0 or above you should not install Business Directory Plugin. 

3. If you are upgrading it is recommended that you do a manual upgrade rather than using the automatic upgrade option available via your dashboard. If you use the automatic upgrade option please, again, backup your data first.

== Usage Doc ==

For complete documentation on the plugin, please visit the [BD Documentation Site](http://businessdirectoryplugin.com/docs)

1. Setting up your categories

Go to your Dashboard and look for the "Directory" menu box. Listed under the Directory menu box are the links "Add New", "Categories" and "Tags". Click the "Categories" link and add your categories just the same way you would normally add categories under Posts->Categories.

2. Matching the design to your theme

Please visit this page for complete and up-to-date instructions on matching BD to your theme. 

[How to match BD to your theme](http://businessdirectoryplugin.com/docs/matching-the-design-to-your-theme/)

3. Adding a menu of the directory categories

To add a menu of the directory categories to your theme use the code below:
<?php global $wpbdmposttypecategory; wp_list_categories('title_li=&taxonomy='.$wpbdmposttypecategory); ?>
You can filter the function the way you would normally filter wp_list_categories. Just make sure it includes 'taxonomy='.$wpbdmposttypecategory so that it knows you only want the plugin directory categories.

4. Adding a latest posts widget

NEW:  BD now comes with 3 standard widgets--Latest Listings, Random Listings and Featured Listings.  Place in any
widget-ready theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For the definitive FAQ section, please vist the [FAQ Section of the Forum](http://businessdirectoryplugin.com/support-forum/faq)

1. How do I setup my categories?
You setup your categories under the "Directory" menu tab that will appear in the dashboard menu when you install the plugin. Under the Directory menu tab there is a link "Categories". You click this and add your categories the same way you do with your normal WordPress blog.

2. Why isn't the email address showing up in the listings?
The email address is not showing up because it is being programmatically blocked. The reason for this is to protect the privacy of your users so that their email address does not appear for public viewing where email harvesting bots can grab them and add them to spam email lists. 

3. Okay, I understand that the plugin is blocking the email address to protect the user's privacy, but I still prefer to display the email address in the listing pages. How can I do that?
To override the email block, go to the WPBusDirMan menu tab that appears in the dashboard menu. Click the "Manage Options" link. Look under "Miscellaneous settings". You will see an option "Override email Blocking?". Check that option and it should make the email address visible.
