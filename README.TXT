* Professional directory
* Local provider listings (like a Yelp clone)
* A Yellow Pages directory
* Online magazine listings
* Website listings
* Book review sites

= Can I accept paid and free listings? =
Yes it can. You can do this by creating plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time.

= Do you have video tutorials for building WordPress directories? =
Yes we do. They can be found [here](https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/video-tutorials/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).

= Will this plugin work with my theme? =
Our WP directory plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

Whatever theme you pick, we recommend using the Theme Check plugin (available for free on WordPress.org) to validate a theme. The more errors and warnings you see on the theme when you run that check, the worse the theme is. You can read more about it at https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/

= Can I translate my web directories? =
Yes! We offer many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. It is already available in the following languages:

* Spanish
* French
* German
* Russian
* Italian
* Polish
* Arabic
* Swedish

And you can also easily [translate it yourself](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/business-directory-plugin/).

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the sub sites you need it.

This can be done under Plugins -> Add New as the Administrator user. Do not "network activate" as the "super admin".

== Changelog ==

* Rename "Fee Plan" to "Plan" since they can be free.
* Add modal confirmation for deleting a field and plan.

* Fix: Images weren't uploading during listing imports.
* Fix: Only load the admin BD scripts on BD pages.
* Fix: The image ordering wasn't saving in the front-end listing form.
* Fix: When creating a listing from the admin area, set the image limits based on the newly selected plan.

* Fix: Allow manual enable/disable of default plan.
* Fix: PHP warning showing on license page on some sites.

* Added wpbdp_display_field_wrapper_classes hook to add extra classes to a field wrapper.
* Fix: Get rid of button styling on delete link so it shows as a red link instead of a button.
* Fix: Make the featured banner work better by not pushing content around. Now it overlaps the image.
* Add a bit more caching and a performance lift.
