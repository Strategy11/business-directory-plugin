= Can Business Directory Plugin support paid and free listings? =
Yes it can. You can do this by creating fee plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time. For more details, read [this article](https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/knowledge-base/how-to-run-bd-in-free-mode/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).

= Do you have video tutorials for Business Directory Plugin? =
Yes we do. They can be found [here](https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/video-tutorials/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).

= Will Business Directory Plugin work with my theme? =
Business Directory Plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

Whatever theme you pick, we recommend using the Theme Check plugin (available for free on WordPress.org) to validate how WordPress-compliant that theme actually is. The more errors and warnings you see on the theme when you run that check, the worse the theme is. You can read more about it at https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/

(This plugin was developed by WP Core developers to validate their own default themes and is highly respected in the theme community)

In general, we like WooThemes as a solid company with great products and support. You can check them out [here](http://woothemes.com) Or [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com​​)

= Can Business Directory Plugin be translated into my language? =
Yes it can. Business Directory Plugin comes with many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. It is already available in the following languages:

* Spanish
* French
* German
* Russian
* Italian
* Polish
* Arabic
* Swedish

And you can also easily [translate it yourself](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/business-directory-plugin/).

= Is Business Directory Plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network-activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory. This can be done under Plugins->Add New as the Administrator user. Do not "network activate" BD as the "super admin".

= What types of Directories can Business Directory Plugin help me build? =
Our directory website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful business directory plugin on the market. The options are limitless. Here are a few types of directories you can create:

* Business directory
* Company directory
* Team directory
* Member directory
* Staff directory
* Hotel directory
* Medical directory
* Restaurant directory
* Church directory
