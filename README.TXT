= Can I accept paid and free listings? =
Yes it can. You can do this by creating fee plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time. For more details, read [this article](https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/knowledge-base/how-to-run-bd-in-free-mode/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).

= Do you have video tutorials for building WordPress directories? =
Yes we do. They can be found [here](https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/video-tutorials/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).

= Will Business Directory Plugin work with my theme? =
Our WP Directory plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

Whatever theme you pick, we recommend using the Theme Check plugin (available for free on WordPress.org) to validate a theme. The more errors and warnings you see on the theme when you run that check, the worse the theme is. You can read more about it at https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/

= Can I translate my web directories? =
Yes! We offer many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. It is already available in the following languages:

* Spanish
* French
* German
* Russian
* Italian
* Polish
* Arabic
* Swedish

And you can also easily [translate it yourself](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/business-directory-plugin/).

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the sub sites you need it.

This can be done under Plugins -> Add New as the Administrator user. Do not "network activate" as the "super admin".

= What types of directories can I build? =
Our directory website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful business directory plugin on the market. The options are limitless. Here are a few types of directories you can create:

* Business listings
* Company directory
* Team directory
* Member directory
* Staff directory / Employee directory
* Hotel directory
* Medical directory
* Restaurant directory
* Church directory
* Travel review directories
* Software review sites
